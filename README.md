# to get apps on old IOS versions
If anyone else is in the situation where I am where I'm using a iPhone 6 and can't get a large majority of apps because "they require a newer version of IOS" this might be useful for you. Using this old version of iTunes, you can download any app to your computer for some reason, and that then allows you to go to your purchased apps on your iPhone 6 and download a older version of the app that apple would otherwise block. This actually works for many apps, including:

Chrome 

Discord 

Most Google apps

Retroarch 

PPSSPP

the apple office suite

the Microsoft office suite 

YouTube 

Clash of clans 

Minecraft 



This can also be done with a newer iPhone but I know a lot of us don't have those.



Go over to the iTunes store tab on iTunes. Click the search bar and search for the app you want. Click download, then sign into your apple ID. The app with then actually download as an IPA file onto your PC, but you don't need this file. All you need to do is go into your purchased content on the app store on your iPhone 6 and download your app.

# Getting IPA files 
On the windows version of iTunes, click the store tab, then search for the app you want. Click the download button. You will then have to sign in. The app will end up in a folder in your iTunes directory, that is usually in c:/users/youruser/music/iTunes. You will find a folder for apps in there. In there will be your IPAs. You can even get IPAs for paid apps that you own, but please don't distribute those because, you know, piracy laws and all that.
